 Set of tools designed to help make TAS code videos like
 the ones featured on [bisqwit's channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Bisqwit)

## Scope

Yet to be defined. I do want to make some interactive editor for the
choreography. I don't know if I want to make this a web application or not.

Proof-of-concept will be written in Python for now.
